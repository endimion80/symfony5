# symfony5
OAT for check

the Main Idea is creating two services (autowired) one capable to reading csv files
and another one for reaing json files, this code could be callable from every part 
of my symfony code and when they are implemented they must recieve as a parameter the
file wich must be readed, the csv or json one.
The response must be an Object wich is exposed as an api.

FYI
